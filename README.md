# Working-with-collections
This contains a work of all you can do with Java Collections.
Well as a starter it will be an eye opener if you refer to the implementation of Stack using ArrayList. Then some of the other works using the magic of LinkedList include:

* Finding sum of two linked lists. 
* Finding the point of merge of the two lists.
* Reversing every K nodes of a linked list.
